# NeoGo node configuration file

This section contains detailed NeoGo node configuration file description
including default config values and tips to set up configurable values.

Each config file contains two sections. `ApplicationConfiguration` describes node-related
settings and `ProtocolConfiguration` contains protocol-related settings. See the
[Application Configuration](#Application-Configuration) and
[Protocol Configuration](#Protocol-Configuration) sections for details on configurable
values.
